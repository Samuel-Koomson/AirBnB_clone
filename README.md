# AirBnB_clone
# ALX team work between Samuel Koomson and Tsion Kabtyimer
# AirBnB clone project!
# ToDo
# write a comman interpreter to manage our AirBnb object.
# A command interpreter:- It is exactly the same with shell but
  limited to a specific Use-case.
# we want to manage the objects of our project:
	* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
	* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
	* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
	* Update attributes of an object
	* Destroy an object
